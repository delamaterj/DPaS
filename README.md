Welcome to Joshua's Data Processing and Storage system!

Here's how to use the program:
  ~ You will be prompted with a menu containing the five functionalities that needed to be implemented (as well as an exit option)
  Feel free to mess around with them, you should be able to see all the rules and requirements in action
  ~ Honestly it should be straightforward enough as long as you have python you can run it in powershell/cmd or whatever using
  python main.py
  or PyCharm or whatever (did I mention this program was in python?)
  ~ If you have any questions/concerns you have my contact info on Canvas

  Tbh I liked this assignment and I think this should be an official part of the cirriculum. But before that happens this assignment should:
  ~ Include a template for the main() or more detailed instructions for the student and/or grader to test the code
  ~ Include a sample output (similiar to other programming classes) since programming language is a flexible aspect of this assignment
